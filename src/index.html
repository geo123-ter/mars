            <p> Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons,
                 which is about 13.6 miles (22 kilometers) high, and a massive canyon system called 
                 Valles Marineris that stretches over 2,500 miles (4,000 kilometers). The planet has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are thought to be captured 
                 asteroids. Mars has been a target for exploration by various space missions, including rovers and orbiters, to study its geology, climate, and potential for past or present life.</p>
